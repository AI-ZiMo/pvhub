Project Structure (/src folder):

1. Application (src/app)
   - Contains page.tsx and layout.tsx for each route
   - Handles routing and page structure

   - Follows component-based architecture

4. Library (src/lib)
   - Contains utility code:

     • Context providers
     • Application logic

5. Services (src/lib/services)

   - Handles database operations
   - Manages data transformation
   - Separates business logic from API routes

6. Database (src/db)

   - Manages database client setup
   - src/db/index.ts is used for the database client configuration
